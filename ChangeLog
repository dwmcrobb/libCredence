	configure, configure.ac:

	Added support for boost::asio::local::stream_protocol::socket.
	Not ideal at the moment since I duplicated the streams, but it
	works.  Requires C++20 due to libDwm now requiring it.

	* tagged as libDwmCredence-0.1.21

	* classes/src/DwmCredenceServerConfigParse.y:
	Type of second argument to credenceservercfg_scan_bytes() is
	different for different versions of flex. :-(  Update all of
	my hosts to at least flex 2.6.4 so I have consistent 'int'
	as second argument type.

	* Deal with boost moving in recent MacPorts for Sonoma, and
	slightly modernize my autoconf (the parts I am using here).

	* Tagged as libDwmCredence-0.1.15

	* classes/src/DwmCredenceXChaCha20Poly1305.cc: Log exception what()
	if we catch a atd::exception.

	* Tagged as libDwmCredence-0.1.13

	* classes/src/DwmCredenceXChaCha20Poly1305.cc: Don't put our write
	buffers on the stack.  We might have very large messages to
	encrypt/decrypt and hence using the heap is more appropriate.
	We're passed a string reference for output; just resize() it and
	populate it.  Catch exceptions sinze resize() can throw.

	* DwmCredenceKeyExchanger.cc: Add GetSetSocketNoDelayOption()
	function, currently unused.
