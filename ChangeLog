	* classes/src/DwmCredenceXChaCha20Poly1305.cc: Don't put our write
	buffers on the stack.  We might have very large messages to
	encrypt/decrypt and hence using the heap is more appropriate.
	We're passed a string reference for output; just resize() it and
	populate it.  Catch exceptions sinze resize() can throw.

	* DwmCredenceKeyExchanger.cc: Add GetSetSocketNoDelayOption()
	function, currently unused.
